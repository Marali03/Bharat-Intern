                                  TITANIC CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS REPORT
1. Introduction
   
The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset widely used for predictive modeling and machine learning. The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, class, fare, and others.

3. Data Preprocessing
   
2.1 Handling Missing Values
The 'Cabin' column was dropped due to a large number of missing values.
Rows with missing values in other columns were removed.
Categorical variables like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' were converted to numerical format.
Dummy variables were created for categorical features.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   
3.1 Data Overview
The dataset contains information on 891 passengers and 12 features.
Features include 'Pclass,' 'Sex,' 'Age,' 'SibSp,' 'Parch,' 'Fare,' and more.

3.2 Visualization
Bar charts were used to visualize survival rates based on 'Sex' and 'Pclass.'
Histograms depicted the distribution of 'Age' and 'Fare.'
Heatmap visualized missing values in the dataset.

4. Model Implementation

   
4.1 Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression was applied to predict survival.
The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
The model achieved approximately 88.9% accuracy on the training data and 81.2% on the test data.


4.2 Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest Classifier was implemented for survival prediction.
Feature importance was visualized, revealing significant predictors.
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 79% on the test data.


5. Conclusion and Recommendations

   
The analysis successfully addressed missing values and transformed categorical variables.
Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models were applied with reasonable accuracy.
Feature importance analysis identified key predictors for survival.
Further model tuning and exploration of additional features could enhance predictive performance.
